# Handling-missing-values:
Handling missing values is an important step in data preprocessing. Missing data can arise due to various reasons such as data collection errors, incomplete data, or data not being available for some observations. Here are some common methods for handling missing values:

### Deletion:
Deletion involves removing the missing values from the dataset.

### Imputation: 
Imputation involves replacing missing values with estimated values. This can be done using various techniques such as:
Mean, median, or mode imputation: This involves replacing missing values with the mean, median, or mode value of the variable.

### Multiple imputation: 
This involves creating multiple imputed datasets and combining them to create a single dataset that includes estimates for the missing values.

### Regression imputation: 
This involves using a regression model to predict the missing values based on the values of other variables.
### K-nearest neighbor imputation: This involves using the values of the k nearest neighbors to predict the missing values.

The choice of method for handling missing values will depend on the nature of the data and the specific research question being addressed. It is important to carefully consider the potential implications of each method and to select the most appropriate approach based on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.
